## Conclusion

This project gave me ample opportunity to learn a variety of technolgies. I was able to use React, Redux and Node simaultaneously. It gave me more understanding on how to manage redux store in a relatively complex React App. I was able to use 2 authentication technolgies for users of the app. However, there are still some areas that can be improved upon such as `Adding Real time chat app amongst users`, `Making image uploads more scalable using Cloudinary or S3` and a host of other things.
